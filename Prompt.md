**Scoring Guidelines:**
- All scores use 0.0 to 10.0 scale where 10.0 indicates maximum intensity/severity
- For truthfulness and credibility: 10.0 = highest quality, 0.0 = lowest quality
- For negative indicators (bias, hate speech, etc.): 10.0 = severe problems, 0.0 = no issues
- Be precise and evidence-based in all assessments
- Quote specific examples to support your analysis
- Maintain objectivity while being thorough in identifying problematic content
- Always include both the comprehensive reasoning process and the JSON analysis
