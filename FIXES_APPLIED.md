# TruthScore Fixes Applied - December 2024

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve critical issues identified in the TruthScore application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python 3.13 Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Python 3.13.0 caused import errors with pyannote.audio 3.1.0
- `cannot import name 'Pipeline' from 'pyannote.audio'`
- Incompatible dependency versions

**Solution**:
- Updated `requirements.txt` to use pyannote.audio >= 3.3.0 (Python 3.13 compatible)
- Added fallback import mechanism in `app.py` for both new and legacy Pipeline imports
- Created `upgrade_dependencies.sh` script for clean dependency upgrades

### 2. Audio Transcription Timeout Issues

**Problem**: Transcriptions consistently timing out after 5 minutes
- Churchill speech (5:50 duration) timing out during processing
- Insufficient timeout for longer audio files

**Solution**:
- Extended timeout from 5 minutes (300s) to 15 minutes (900s)
- Optimized Faster-Whisper model settings for better performance
- Added GPU acceleration detection and optimization

### 3. Language Detection Issues

**Problem**: Faster-Whisper incorrectly detecting Welsh ('cy') instead of English
- Caused poor transcription quality for English content
- Language detection probability of 0.67 for Welsh was incorrect

**Solution**:
- Force English language detection with `language="en"` parameter
- Added optimized transcription parameters:
  - `beam_size=5` (reduced for speed)
  - `temperature=0.0` (deterministic output)
  - Better threshold settings

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Slow transcription processing and resource usage
- Base model using too much resources
- Suboptimal device utilization

**Solution**:
- **2025-06-18**: Changed default model from "small" to "tiny" for fastest processing
- Previous: Changed default model from "base" to "small" for better speed/accuracy balance
- Added intelligent device detection (CUDA vs CPU)
- Optimized compute types (float16 for GPU, float32 for CPU)
- Limited CPU threads to prevent system overload

### 5. Speaker Diarization Robustness

**Problem**: Fragile speaker diarization setup prone to import failures

**Solution**:
- Added dual Pipeline import strategy (pyannote.audio and pyannote.pipeline)
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Better logging for troubleshooting

### 6. Multi-Stage Analysis Framework Implementation

**Problem**: Single-stage prompt analysis was too simplistic and didn't provide structured evaluation approach
- Lacked systematic content classification
- No clear methodology for understanding speaker intent and audience
- Missing comprehensive bias and tone analysis
- No framework for determining appropriate response type

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive 4-stage analysis framework:

#### Stage 1: Initial Classification
- **WHO** is speaking? (journalist, politician, scientist, influencer, etc.)
- **WHAT KIND** of content? (speech, educational video, political statement, etc.)
- Provides essential context for subsequent analysis stages

#### Stage 2: Context & Intent  
- **WHY** is this being said? (persuade, inform, entertain, provoke, etc.)
- **FOR WHOM** is the target audience? (general public, voters, students, etc.)
- Establishes purpose and intended impact

#### Stage 3: Content Analysis
- **MAIN CLAIMS** identification and summarization
- **BIAS, TONE, EMOTION** detection and analysis
- Core message evaluation with systematic approach

#### Stage 4: Output Framing
- **IDEAL RESPONSE TYPE** determination based on analysis
- **FINAL CREDIBILITY SCORE** (1-100) incorporating all stages
- Systematic scoring methodology

**Technical Implementation**:
```json
{
  "stage_1_classification": {
    "speaker_identified": "<speaker name/category>",
    "speaker_confidence": 0-100,
    "content_type": "<content type>",
    "classification_reasoning": "<explanation>"
  },
  "stage_2_context": {
    "speaker_intent": "<what speaker is trying to achieve>",
    "target_audience": "<intended audience>",
    "context_reasoning": "<explanation>"
  },
  "stage_3_content": {
    "main_claims": ["claim 1", "claim 2"],
    "tone_analysis": "<emotional tone>",
    "bias_indicators": ["bias 1", "bias 2"],
    "emotional_elements": ["element 1", "element 2"]
  },
  "stage_4_output": {
    "ideal_response_type": "<response approach>",
    "credibility_score": 1-100,
    "credibility_reasoning": "<detailed explanation>",
    "key_factors": ["factor 1", "factor 2"]
  }
}
```

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with existing frontend by including traditional fields alongside new multi-stage structure.

**Benefits**:
- More systematic and comprehensive analysis
- Better understanding of context and intent
- Improved credibility scoring methodology
- Enhanced bias and tone detection
- Clearer reasoning for final assessments

- Review timeout settings based on typical audio file lengths

## Validation

✅ **Application Status**: Successfully initialized with transcription functionality
✅ **Core Dependencies**: All essential packages installed and working
✅ **Multi-Stage Analysis**: New systematic evaluation framework implemented
⚠️ **Limitation**: Speaker diarization disabled due to Python 3.13 PyTorch compatibility

### Test Results
- ✅ Application starts without errors
- ✅ Faster-Whisper model loads successfully (small model, CPU-only)
- ✅ Core transcription functionality available
- ✅ Multi-stage analysis framework operational
- ⚠️ Speaker diarization disabled (PyTorch not available for Python 3.13)

### Test the fixes with the original Churchill speech:
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXIrnU7Y_RU
- Expected: Successful transcription without timeout (no speaker identification)
- Language should be detected as English
- Processing should complete within 10-15 minutes
- **New**: Multi-stage analysis should provide systematic evaluation

### For Full Functionality
To enable speaker diarization, consider:
1. Using Python 3.11 or 3.12 instead of 3.13
2. Waiting for PyTorch Python 3.13 support
3. Using the application in transcription-only mode (current setup)

## Recent Updates

### Multi-Stage Analysis Framework (2025-06-18)

**Implementation**: Complete revamp of the analysis prompt system to implement a systematic 4-stage evaluation methodology that provides more structured and comprehensive content analysis while maintaining backward compatibility with existing frontend systems.

### Transcription Timeout and Robustness Improvements (2025-06-17)

**Problem**: The application was experiencing timeouts during transcription of longer videos (>5 minutes), particularly when processing audio files around 6 minutes in length. The transcription would reach about 70% completion and then fail with a timeout error.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Fixed timeout was too aggressive for larger files
2. Whisper model could get stuck with complex audio
3. Speaker diarization had no timeout protection
4. Limited fallback mechanisms when primary transcription failed

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Dynamic Timeout Calculation**:
   - Replaced fixed 15-minute timeout with dynamic timeout based on file size
   - Base timeout: 10 minutes + 2 minutes per MB of audio
   - Provides more reasonable timeouts for different file sizes

2. **Transcription Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Added fallback transcription settings when primary settings fail
   - Primary: optimized settings (beam_size=3, best_of=3, word_timestamps=True)
   - Fallback: minimal settings (beam_size=1, best_of=1, word_timestamps=False)
   - Ensures transcription completion even with challenging audio

3. **Speaker Diarization Timeout Protection**:
   - Added 5-minute timeout for speaker diarization specifically
   - Falls back gracefully to standard transcription if diarization times out
   - Prevents entire transcription process from failing due to diarization issues

4. **Robust Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced error handling throughout transcription pipeline
   - Better logging for debugging timeout and performance issues
   - Graceful degradation when components fail

**Results**:
- Successfully processed 6-minute Churchill speech that previously timed out
- Improved transcription success rate for longer audio files
- Better user experience with more reliable processing
- Enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities

### Enhanced Logging and Error Tracking (2025-06-17)

**Improvements**:
1. **Comprehensive Request Tracking**: Every request now has a unique ID for tracking through all stages
2. **Performance Metrics**: Duration tracking for all major operations (transcription, analysis, research)
3. **Enhanced Error Context**: Better error messages with request context
4. **Stage-by-Stage Progress**: Detailed progress tracking through each analysis phase

**Log File Structure**:
- `logs/app.log`: General application events and request flow
- `logs/analysis.log`: Detailed analysis operations and performance metrics
- `logs/api.log`: API call tracking (OpenAI, web research)
- `logs/errors.log`: Comprehensive error logging with stack traces

This comprehensive logging infrastructure enables better troubleshooting and performance optimization.

### Fixed Request Tracking and "Request Not Found" Errors (2025-06-18)

**Problem**: Users experienced "request not found" errors and continuous reloading loops when using the main analysis function. This was caused by:
1. Flask debug mode restarts clearing in-memory request tracking data
2. Premature cleanup of request data immediately after returning results
3. Race conditions between rapid frontend polling and backend data deletion
4. No persistence of request state across application restarts

**Root Causes**:
- `progress_store` and `results_store` dictionaries were reset on every Flask restart
- `/results` endpoint deleted data immediately after first access
- Frontend polled both `/progress` and `/results` every 500ms, creating race conditions
- No error recovery for missing request data

**Implemented Solutions**:

1. **Persistent Request Tracking**:
   - Added `request_tracking.json` file for persistence across restarts
   - Implemented `load_request_tracking()` and `save_request_tracking()` functions
   - Request data survives Flask debug mode restarts

2. **Removed Premature Cleanup**:
   - Stopped deleting results immediately after access
   - Implemented time-based cleanup (1-hour retention)
   - Added `cleanup_old_requests()` function for memory management

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Updated `/progress` endpoint to return 200 status instead of 404 for missing requests
   - Added better error state detection and reporting
   - Improved frontend error handling for various failure scenarios

4. **Race Condition Prevention**:
   - Multiple API calls no longer interfere with each other
   - Results remain accessible for repeated polling
   - Better status differentiation between processing, completed, and error states

5. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Better handling of error states in progress data
   - More resilient polling that doesn't fail on temporary network issues
   - Clear error messages for different failure types

**Technical Changes**:
- Added persistent storage for `progress_store` and `results_store`
- Modified `/results/<request_id>` endpoint to not delete data immediately
- Enhanced `/progress/<request_id>` endpoint with better error handling
- Updated `set_progress()` method to save data persistently
- Improved error state handling in `background_analyze()`
- Enhanced frontend polling logic in `static/js/app.js`

**Results**:
- Eliminated "request not found" errors
- Stopped continuous reloading loops
- Requests survive Flask restarts in debug mode
- Better user experience with clear error messaging
- Reduced race conditions between frontend polling
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory buildup

**Files Modified**:
- `app.py`: Added persistence layer and improved endpoint handling
- `static/js/app.js`: Enhanced error handling and polling logic
- `.gitignore`: Added request tracking file exclusion

This fix ensures robust request tracking that survives application restarts and provides a smooth user experience without "request not found" errors or continuous reloading issues.
